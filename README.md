- [Data](./Data/) - Training data.
- [FilesUsed](./FilesUsed/) - Input files for model evaluation.
- [Resources](./Resources/) - Additional development resources.
- [Submissions](./Submissions/) - Model submission zip files by date.
- [Test-mymodelfile](./Test-mymodelfile/) - Testing `mymodelfile` and preparing submission zip file.
- [Venue-Team-Mapping](./Venue-Team-Mapping/) - Mapping data for handling naming inconsistencies.
- [Backup-Timeline](./Backup-Timeline/) - Date-wise progress backup.

## Solution Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**:

   - Cleaned and transformed raw data.
   - Selected relevant features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

   - Analyzed data for insights.
   - Used visualizations for patterns.

3. **Feature Engineering**:

   - Created new features.
   - Applied techniques like one-hot encoding.

4. **Model Selection**:

   - Chose suitable regression models.
   - Considered linear, ridge, lasso, and more.

5. **Model Training and Evaluation**:

   - Split data into train/test sets.
   - Evaluated with metrics like MAE, MSE, R-squared.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:

   - Tuned model parameters.
   - Improved model performance.

7. **Final Model Selection and Deployment**:
   - Chose the best-performing model.
   - Deployed for predictions on new data.

## The Story

- My first hackathon.
- No prior ML or Python experience.
- Had to learn ML and Python from scratch.
- Started with a team of three, but they left due to not feeling ready for ML.
- Continued solo and kept improving the project.
- Development history in the backup timeline.
- Feel free to explore and reach out.
